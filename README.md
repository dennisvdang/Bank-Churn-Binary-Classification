## Bank Customer Churn Prediction

This case study focuses on building a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a bank. Customer churn, which refers to customers leaving a company or service, is a critical issue for businesses as it directly impacts revenue and growth. By accurately predicting which customers are likely to churn, the bank can take proactive measures to retain them, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and reducing customer acquisition costs.

The case study utilizes a dataset containing information about bank customers, including their demographic characteristics, account details, and whether they have churned or not. The goal is to develop a robust binary classification model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to leave the bank based on the available features.

### Approach

The project follows a structured approach to building and evaluating the classification model:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The dataset is explored to understand the characteristics of the features and the target variable (Exited). This step involves visualizing the data, identifying patterns, and potential relationships between the features and the target variable.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numerical features. Additionally, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is employed to address the class imbalance in the dataset, where the number of churned customers (minority class) is much smaller than the non-churned customers (majority class).

3. **Baseline Model**: A Logistic Regression model is used as the baseline model, and a grid search is performed to find the best hyperparameters (regularization strength and optimization algorithm).

4. **Advanced Models**: More advanced techniques, such as Random Forest and XGBoost, are implemented, leveraging ensemble methods and hyperparameter optimization using Bayesian optimization.

5. **Model Evaluation**: The models are evaluated on a validation set using various metrics, including confusion matrices, classification reports, ROC AUC scores, and ROC curves. These metrics provide insights into the models' strengths and weaknesses in predicting customer churn.

6. **Model Selection**: Based on the evaluation results, the best-performing model is selected for potential deployment, considering factors such as model performance, complexity, and interpretability, as well as specific business requirements.

The project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a binary classification model, from data exploration and preprocessing to model development, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation. The techniques employed, such as ensemble methods and Bayesian optimization, showcase advanced machine learning concepts and their practical applications in solving real-world problems.
